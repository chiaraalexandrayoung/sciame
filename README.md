Elementi d'informatica per il design – Elaborato esame Riboli 2020/2021 ISIA U

The project aims to make visible and concrete what an oral tradition couldn’t easily document.
Realized through the development of glitches with Resolume Arena, the distortion of images becomes a metaphor for both the alteration of consciousness and memory. The oral handing down of shamanic songs fragments and pulverizes, breaks down and reassembles, taking on new meanings as the song changes.
As catalyst of imaginary experiences in an introspective space, the sound directs the movement of particles, in an unpredictable and ethereal dance.
The unstable surfaces, created using TouchDesigner, were produced following the study of these dances, inspired by the movement of snow and dust as a metaphor for mobility and restlessness. The presence of this component is constant throughout the book and is aimed at emphasizing the concept of nomadism, which characterizes the tribes concerned.
